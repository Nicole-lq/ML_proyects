## [1. Analysis of a Tragedy](Analisis_de_una_tragedia/RF_Adaboost_Titanic.ipynb)

### Objective

Predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using variables such as gender, class, and ticket cost.

### Algorithms Used

* Random Forest
* AdaBoost

## [2. Salary Clustering](Clustering/Modelos_de_clustering.ipynb)

### Objective

Perform a clustering analysis on the salaries of various professions across 44 cities worldwide.

### Algorithms Used
* PCA
* K-Means
* Dendrograms

## [3. Diamond Price Prediction](Prediccion_de_precios/Prediccion_de_precios.ipynb)

### Objective

Predict the price of diamonds based on attributes such as carat, cut, color, and clarity using a decision tree model.

### Algorithms Used

* Decision Tree (`DecisionTreeClassifier`)

## [4. Survival in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)](Supervivencia_en_UCI/Supervivencia_UCI.ipynb)

### Objective

Develop a decision tree-based model to predict the survival of ICU patients based on their vital signs, chronic diseases, and comorbidities.

### Algorithms Used

* Decision Tree (`DecisionTreeRegressor`)
